             Hearty        congratulations        to     the

             Department of Forensic Science on the
             launch  of  the  inaugural  edition  of
             "Aequitas,"  the  annual  magazine  that
             showcases  the  achievements,  research,
             and  insights  of  the  Department  of
             Forensic Science.


             "Aequitas,"  which  I  understand  means
             fairness  and  justice,  aptly  reflects  the
             values and principles that underpin the
             field    of   Forensic     Science.     I   am
             immensely  proud  of  the  dedication,
             innovation,           and          excellence
             demonstrated  by  the  faculty  members                          DR. CALISTUS JUDE A.L.
             and  students  in  the  Department  of                                    DEAN,
             Forensic  Science  towards  bringing  out                         FACULTY OF SCIENCE
             this maiden issue.


             Within the pages of Aequitas, I find insightful articles, groundbreaking research
             findings, and inspiring stories that highlight the department's achievements and
             the impact it has had on the student community and the society.


             I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the faculty members, students, and staff who
             have  contributed  to  "Aequitas."  Your  dedication,  passion,  and  expertise  have
             made  this  magazine  a  valuable  resource  that  can  be  referred  by  the  academic

             community of our institution, other stakeholders and well-wishers.


             I wish "Aequitas" and the Department of Forensic Science every success in the
             years to come. May this magazine serve as a beacon of knowledge, inspiration
             and innovation in the field of Forensic Science.]]></page><page Index="5"><![CDATA[ADVISORY  BOARD

                   word:  "AMAZING."  Giving  up  the                       brain, not books. The skill to

                   idea  of  being  an  anaesthetist  and                   master  the  art  of  forensics

             ‘The  hallway  was  empty.  I  could  sense  the  smell  of

             cigarettes getting close’




             It was the last thing I heard from her and the phone got

             disconnected.  Thank  you  Jain  for  giving  the  statement,

             now  you  can  leave  and  please  restrict  going  out  of  the

             town for at least a few days and provide your personal

             information to the constable sitting over there.





             I  headed  towards  the  parcel  that  was  delivered  on  my

             name  to  my  office.  I  was  too  busy  in  my  work  that  I

             couldn’t keep a memory of this parcel awaiting for me. I

             went  upstairs  and  along  each  of  the  stairs  I  climbed,  I

             recollected the information given by the I-witness. I was

             not  able  to  link  or  connect  why  the  girl  who  got

             kidnapped called this man who is not even someone too

             close  to  her.  Even  if  he  proclaimed  her  to  be  his  close

             friend,  the  others  have  clearly  mentioned  he  was    was

             just  an  acquaintance.  Wishing  all  my  thoughts  away,  I


             started opening the gift box. Opening the gift box, I saw

             the photograph of the girl who went missing with a red

             ink  crossing  her  neck  and  a  note  was  given  which  was

             empty.  Rushing  I  immediately  called  the  Questioned

             Document wing and made sure I do not contaminate the

             evidence.  Things  started  hitting  me  harder  now,  this  is

             not  a  common  kidnap  case-  if  the  kidnapper  who  is

             ultimately a murderer can send me a parcel with a blank

             note,  he  wants  to  involve  on  challenge  the  whole

             department into this.




                                                                                                              33]]></page><page Index="42"><![CDATA[AEQUITAS VOLUME: 1, ISSUE: 1






             The report came after a few hours and it was a hidden message

             giving a hint of something and just the place name with street

             code was mentioned. My team and the police officers rushed to

             the scene of crime and we found the girl dead there.




             The whole investigation took a turn and all we got is the dead

             body, the gift packet and this phone call the deceased did to her


             friend. On receiving the autopsy result the next day things started

             becoming more intrigued. The media pressure was too much as

             the body was dumped in an open place in a field. The body should

             have been dragged from the main road as we were able to find

             traces of blood on the path of dragging and tyre marks were seen

             on the road. Evidence were sent to FSLs and when I received the

             reports of autopsy it was seen that the girl was brutally tortured

             and killed with cuts all over body and chilli powder applied on it

             just like a fish is killed and prepared to cook.




             Since it was a secondary scene of crime we couldn't collect many


             evidences from there and it forced us to find where the actual

             crime happened. Only one thing that didn't fall in place was the

             testimony given by the eye witness Jain. On taking a background

             check on him, all his records were clear- no cases registered, no

             due fines and no traces of being a smoker. Next day I woke up

             with  a  call  saying  a  similar  murder  took  place  where  the

             information of the dead was received through a call to the police

             station.










                                                                                                              34]]></page><page Index="43"><![CDATA[AEQUITAS VOLUME: 1, ISSUE: 1

             This time, I made up my mind to catch him because he

             did a serious flaw in his crime- the pattern of the killing

             was the same- killed and marinated like a fish and ashes

             of cigarettes on it.





             Two dead bodies, both women of the same age and same

             modus  operandi  of  murder.  No  leads  except  the  trace

             marks of tire and the digital evidence of the person who

             rang  to  the  police  station  and  one  suspect-  Jain.  Only

             thing I could have possibly done is keeping a trail on Jain

             and  analyzing  his  payment  details.  It  was  seen  he

             withdraw  money  everyday  and  that  too  around  500-

             1000 rupees. Where did he spent this money? What did

             he  buy?  And  on  the  list  of  transactions  we  saw  a  store

             where he often went. The CCTV footages of the shop was


             checked  in  which  it  was  clearly  shown  him  buying

             packets of cigarettes.




             Why  would  a  person  buy  cigarettes  if  he  don’t  smoke.

             The  order  of  arrest  for  Jain  was  summoned  and  on

             questioning  him  we  saw  a  psychotic  side  of  him

             unfolding right in front of the eyes. Jain committed the

             murders  and  gave  a  false  testimony  so  that  the

             investigation  wont  lead  to  him.  He  committed  the  first


             murder  and  it  was  nothing  but  a  mistake.  But  this
             mistake lead him to commit more sins.





             From  his  childhood  onwards  he  has  grown  in  a  family

             where  his  dad  was  a  fisherman  and  smoked  day  and

             night.


                                                                                                              35]]></page><page Index="44"><![CDATA[AEQUITAS VOLUME: 1, ISSUE: 1




             Even  though  he  didn't  smoke,  he  was  addicted  to  the

             smell of cigarettes, the smell of fresh and rotten fish, the

             smell  of  fresh  blood.  Confessing  to  us  he  told  he  really


             loved  the  first  girl  he  killed  and  when  she  showed

             reluctance to reciprocate his love- there is where things

             went  bad.  He  told  it  was  just  a  hit  that  killed  her-

             laughingly he told how he enjoyed cutting her like a fish

             and applying the chilli powder on her. Even if he didn't

             smoke he enjoyed the smell of the cigarette, the smell of

             her  blood  and  couldn't  resist  killing  another  to  get  the

             same excitement and the pleasure of the smells. He told

             he is not guilty for his act and said he believed that one

             could  enjoy  the  pleasure  of  life  when  others  sacrifice.

             Like  a  lunatic  he  laughed  and  smiled.  On  crucially


             examining him the signs of self hurt by cutting his flesh

             and putting cigarettes on his skin was visible and thats

             why its said, only the hurt can hurt another.

             “The  hallway  was  empty,  I  could  sense  the  smell  of

             cigarettes getting too close”




             said  the  old  man  who  passed  by  the  house  of  a  family

             who were brutally murdered.




             So,  the  flashback  here  is;  There  lived  a  family  in  the

             outskirts of Mumbai in Chhatrapati Shivaji Nagar, Wood


             Street,  Mumbai,  India.  There  lived  a  tiny  family  in  the

             ‘Pearl  Castle’  apartment.  They  were  brutally  murdered

             and  the  dead  bodies  of  all  the  family  members  were

             thrown  all  over  the  house.  The  members  of  the  family

             are Father- Ram Rao, and the Mother- Savithri Bai, these

             young  couples  had  their  children  named  Darshan  who

             was  7  years  old  and  Keerthi  who  was  in  her  teenage

             years being 19 years old.




             This murder had happened on December 3rd 2022, but

             the police and the neighbouring people got this news 10


             days  later  after  their  family  found  missing  and  the

             neighbours had got a weird smell near their house. After

             the  neighbours  got  a  weird  smell  they  assumed  that

             something inappropriate would have happened and had

             immediately called the police. After some time the police

             crew arrived at the ‘Pearl Castle’ apartment and stood in

             front of Mr. Ram Rao’s house and even he witnessed the

             weird smell there. So, the police officers decided to break

             the door as they assumed that this weird smell feels like

             the smell of dead bodies.




                                                                                                              37]]></page><page Index="46"><![CDATA[AEQUITAS VOLUME: 1, ISSUE: 1



             Because  the  police  officers  had  already  experienced

             many  things  like  this.  And  then  they  vigorously  broke

             the door and as they stepped into Mr. Ram’s house, they

             found everything being shattered around the house. The

             police  first  found  a  little  boy  lying  in  the  hall,  the  boy

             was no one but Mr. Ram’s son, Darshan. He was shot by

             the  gun,  he  had  a  bullet  on  his  forehead  and  the  police

             assumed that they shot him with the gun. And then the


             police walked into the kitchen, and there they found Mr.

             Ram Rao and Savithri Bai also dead, but the police didn't

             find any evidence such as a bullet, instead, they found a

             sword  right  next  to  them  and  scars  on  both  Ram’s  and

             Savithri’s neck as well as their hands and legs. The police

             found  blood  stains  all  over  the  kitchen  and  there  was

             black  blood  too.  This  shows  that  they  were  killed  long

             ago.  The  police  collected  all  the  fingerprints  from  the

             sword  and  imprints  from  the  floor.  And  he  also  found

             Ram’s  phone.  The  police  then  went  into  Keerthi’s

             bedroom where they witnessed many brutal things, and


             they  also  assumed  how  brutally  the  girl  was  killed  by

             looking at all the things.




             The  police  as  soon  as  stepping  into  the  room  found  a

             rope,knife,  blade,  belts  and  some  drug  injection  which

             was  injected  on  the  girl’s  neck.  They  even  found

             cigarette packs, broken alcohol bottles and the girl lying

             dead was just covered with a black cloth and was half-

             naked. They also found the girl’s phone and a sim card in

             it.




                                                                                                              38]]></page><page Index="47"><![CDATA[AEQUITAS VOLUME: 1, ISSUE: 1



             The  police  immediately  collected  all  the  evidence  and

             called  the  forensic  serologists,  toxicologists,  a  mobile

             technician and the doctors, and the person who performs

             the  autopsy.  Then  the  forensic  force  immediately

             arrived  at  the  apartment  and  the  autopsy  was

             performed  on  her  and  they  found  numerous  vaginal

             swabs  and  her  head  was  damaged  with  the  alcohol

             bottles  and  belt  marks  all  around  her  body  and  rope


             marks  tied  around  hands  and  legs  and  there  were  bees

             swarming  all  around  her  body.  The  police  officers  and

             the  forensic  scientists  assumed  that  they  brutally

             tortured the girl and killed her.




             They had later on called the mobile technician to unlock

             Keerthi’s  and  Ram’s  phone  and  they  found  few  call

             recordings  in  Ram’s  phone  telling  if  your  daughter

             doesn’t accept my proposal, I will kill your whole family

             and even in Keerthi’s phone they had found threatening

             messages  and  numerous  calls  from  the  same  number


             which  was  in  Ram’s  phone.  The  police  then  traced  the

             number  and  found  that  it  was  Keethi’s  classmate

             Abhishek whose father was a billionaire, handling many

             business  companies.  And  the  police  also  enquired  all  of

             Ram’s  neighbours  and  they  had  got  clues  from  an  old

             man who passed by Ram’s house on the day this murder

             had taken place. The old man claimed that,




             “The  hallway  was  empty,  I  could  sense  the  smell  of

             cigarettes getting close”




                                                                                                              39]]></page><page Index="48"><![CDATA[AEQUITAS VOLUME: 1, ISSUE: 1



             And then he just went away from there. So, knowing all

             these  it  was  found  out  that  Abhishek  had  raped  and

             brutally murdered Keerthi for denying her proposal and

             he  had  even  killed  her  parents  and  little  brother  for

             stopping  him  from  talking  to  her.  When  they  checked

             the  CCTV  footage  of  the  apartment,  the  police  found  3

             other men with Abhishek and they were fully covering

             themselves  with  masks,  caps  and  gloves.  By  all  the


             evidence from which the police had found, they came to

             a conclusion that Abhishek is the main culprit and the 3

             members  who  were  seen  being  with  him  in  the  CCTV.

             The police then arrested Abhishek and found out that the

             3  other  members  were  also  his  classmates.  And  a  case

             was filed5t] against them under many IPC sections and

             criminal  law  enforcement  for  brutally  murdering

             Keerthi and her family.

             As  the  murder  cases  in  the  city  were  increasing  the

             suspects  number  were  also  increasing  which  were

             innumerable.  As  the  Anthropometric  measurements

             were  taken  to  identify  the  culprit/criminal.  As  time

             passed  the  case  was  getting  cold,  as  there  were  no

             breakthroughs as lead evidence to close the case. people

             were asked to give their semen, saliva samples.





             After a spare of 3 months another murder happened of

             an old man, he was strangled and wasn’t tortured much.

             There was found the trace evidence by the fingerprints

             via DNA, but the criminal was unknown. He was known

             to  be  leaving  the  country  after  the  crime.  The  police

             travelled  places  in  search  of  him,  finding  his  tower

             locations  and  all.  California  was  left  in  fear,  after  two

             months  the  police  found  his  tower  location  to  be  in

             Berlin. The police found that he even committed crimes

             in Berlin, his modus operandi of community crimes was

             that he targeted old men, who were well stabled in their


             lives and had no fear in losing money/property. As the

             offender  was  born  in  a  poor  family  he  always  had  a

             craving  towards  money,  initially  he  used  to  steal  or  do

             burglary  activities  to  get  money  but  stealing  money

             from people by killing them became a hobby to him as

             he did this, in California. The police had reached Berlin to

             capture the offender, as they had his DNA fingerprints,

             they even investigated about his life history, his attitude,

             and physical appearances. He was a 5 foot 7 inches tall

             person. He was bald, had a thick moustache and beard.




                                                                                                              41]]></page><page Index="50"><![CDATA[AEQUITAS VOLUME: 1, ISSUE: 1



             He had a sparkling eye, which was a hazel eye, as hazel

             eyes are rare, so it was easy for the police investigators

             to trace the criminal.




             About his attitude he was kind to his knowing people, he

             was known as ‘Robin Hood of the Franks’. Frank was his

             family name. He even was a chainsmoker, he smokes a

             packet fully a day. His name was Aimen Grace Frank. He


             loves his family, the money he makes by killing people

             was given to his family. But his family members never

             knew that he was a murderer. Finally the police plans to

             capture the criminal at Berlin, he was known to be in a

             hallway  with  one  of  his  girlfriends  on  a  date.  As  the

             police  reached  the  hallway  they  found  his  girlfriend

             dead/ murdered. She was strangled to death, the police

             were getting close to the hallway, but a policeman told,

             the  hallway  was  empty.  I  could  sense  the  smell  of  a

             cigarette getting close.
